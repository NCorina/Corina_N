    <h1>Statement of Research and Design Interests</h1>
    <div class="about-text">


As I near the completion of my PhD in Entrepreneurship, my research has been centered on the concept of authenticity in entrepreneurial contexts—an area that sits at the intersection of perception, identity, and value creation. My dissertation began with a comprehensive literature review on authenticity in entrepreneurship, and has evolved into a conjoint experiment investigating how audiences perceive authenticity, particularly when signals of authenticity lack substantive grounding. This work challenges assumptions about what makes entrepreneurial ventures appear genuine and reveals the cognitive mechanisms behind audience evaluations.
In parallel, I have engaged with diverse methodological approaches, formal modeling in a project aiming at modeling authenticity as a recursive resource with path dependent and non path dependent elements. I also employed hazard modeling in a quantitative study examining acquisition events, and qualitative research using naive coding to explore meaning-making in entrepreneurial narratives emerging from an environmental shock. These experiences have honed my appreciation for methodological pluralism and the power of triangulation in theory-building. I have also combined my research interests with technical proficiency, creating a custom-built app as part of an applied project to collect and analyze behavioral data—an endeavor that reflects my commitment to methodological innovation and my interest in technology as both a research tool and subject.
Looking forward, my postdoctoral research will continue to explore the complex tensions between creativity and technology in entrepreneurship. I am particularly interested in how artificial intelligence reshapes the boundaries of authenticity, and whether perceived "genuineness" can remain a competitive advantage in an increasingly automated world. These questions not only address pressing theoretical gaps but also carry significant implications for entrepreneurial practice in the digital age.
I am eager to deepen my expertise in advanced quantitative methods while broadening my engagement with narrative and interpretive approaches. I believe that integrating computational tools with thoughtful, human-centered inquiry is essential to uncovering insights that matter. My long-term vision is to contribute to research that helps us understand entrepreneurial life more truthfully and profoundly—illuminating the social, technological, and emotional currents that shape ventures and the people behind them.
Ultimately, I view research not only as a scholarly pursuit but as a personal calling: to surface deep truths that can inform, challenge, and improve our shared reality. I seek a postdoctoral environment that values interdisciplinary curiosity, methodological rigor, and the transformative potential of ideas.
