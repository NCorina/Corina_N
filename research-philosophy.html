    <h1>Statement of Research and Design Interests</h1>
    <section>
      <p>
        My research explores the role of authenticity in entrepreneurship — how founders and ventures construct identities, adapt to change, and signal meaning in uncertain environments. I’m particularly interested in how authenticity is experienced and performed, especially in moments of strategic transition.
      </p>
      <p>
        Rooted in organizational theory and qualitative methods, my work bridges disciplines: from social science to storytelling, from data to design. I see research not only as analytical inquiry but also as a creative, interpretive act — a form of sense-making that invites reflection and dialogue.
      </p>
      <p>
        I’m passionate about integrating insights from the arts and technology to enrich both research and practice. Whether through visual methods, interface design, or digital experimentation, I aim to bring form and feeling into my scholarship — to design knowledge that resonates both intellectually and emotionally.
      </p>
      <p>
        This philosophy informs everything I build: interfaces that express identity, data stories that reveal nuance, and research that honors complexity. I believe good scholarship is both rigorous and resonant — and that design is one of its most powerful tools.
